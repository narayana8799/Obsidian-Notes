Basics
--
- `enable` to enter privileged exec mode (`#`) from user  exec mode (`>`).
	- Provides access to view device's configuration, restart the device et.
	- Cannot change the config., but can change the date on the device, save the config file, etc.
- Use  `?` to view all available commands.
- Partial command can be followed by `?` to see all available commands  by the prefix.
	- example `e?`
- `configure terminal` can be used to enter Global Configuration Mode from Privileged exec mode.
- `enable password <password>` can be used to set password for GCM from GCM. This password is asked every time user tries to enter GCM. It used Cisco propriety (7) encryption.
- `enable secret <password>` can also be used to set password for GCM from GCM. This password is asked every time user tries to enter GCM. But it much secure than `enable password` as ==it uses MD5 (5) encryption automatically==.
	- To encrypt password use `service password-encryption` command from GCM. This encrypts the password in configuration file.
- There are 2 types of configuration file's. `startu-config` and `running-config`. `running-config` has the changes we made before saving, to make them persistent we need to save the  config in `sartup-config`, which can be don in 3 different ways. These commands should be executed form privileged exec mode.
	- `write`
	- `write memory`
	- `copy running-config startup-config`
- To execute privileged exec mode commands from GM use `do` as a prefix for the command.
- Commands can be undone by adding `no` as prefix to the command.
	- ex `no service password-encryption`
- `show running-config interface <interface>`, shows only particular interface running configuration. ==Doesn't work in packet tracer.==


Ethernet LAN Switching
--
  - `show arp`, to see the ARP table.
  - `show mac address-table`, to see the mac address table, previous command on old devices is `show mac-address-table`.
  - `clear mac address-table dynamic`
	  - `clear mac address-table address <mac address>` (doesn't work on packet tracer)
	  - `clear mac address-table address interface <interface>` (doesn't work on packet tracer)
- `show ip interface brief` to see status of interfaces.
- `interface gig0/0` to select an interface and `interface range gig0/0-9, 10, gig0/11-14` to select a rang of interfaces
- `decription ## DESCRIPTION ##`, command can be used to set description on an interface.
- `ip address <ip> <mask.mask.mask.mask>`, o set IP on an interface.
- `no shutdown` command enables administratively disabled interfaces, which is default state on router interfaces.
- `show interfaces <interface>` to see layer 1, 2 and partial layer 3 status of an interface.
- `show interfaces description` can be used to read description set on an interface.
- `show interfaces status`, to see interface status such as speed, duplex and type..
- `speed` and `duplex` commands can be used to set them manually.

Static Routing
--
- `ip route <destination-address> <net-mask> <next-hop>`
	- `ip route <destination-address> <net-mask> <exit-interface>`
	- `ip route <destination-address> <net-mask> <exit-interface> <next-hop>`

VLANS
--
- `show vlan brief`
- `show interfaces trunk`
- Creating VLAN's on a switch.
	- `interface range <range>`
	- `switchport mode acces`
	- `switchport acces vlan <number>`, if VLAN doesn't exist, it is created.
- Creating trunk ports.
	- `switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q`, by default encapsulation is set to `auto`. `auto` mode is not allowed by the switch, `dot1q` or `isl` should be used, though `isl` is no longer supported. 
	- `switchport mode trunk`
	- `switchport trunk allowed vlan num, num...`, allows only mentioned VLAN's on the trunk port.
	- `switchport trunk native vlan num`, mentioned VLAN traffic will be untagged, but the native VLAN should match on the other switch.
- ROAS VLAN configuration.
	- `interface g0/1.10`
	- `encapsulation dot1q <vlan-id>`
	- `encapsulation dot1q <vlan-id> native `

- `show spanning-tree [valn <vlan-id>]`
- `show spanning-tree interface <interface> detail`
- `spanning-tree vlan <valn-id> root primary`
- `spanning-tree vlan <valn-id> root secondary`
- `spanning-tree valn <valn-id> cost <cost>`
- `spanning-tree portfast [edge]`, on interface. `spanning-tree portfast [edge] trunk`
	- `sanning-tree portfast [edge] default`, from global configuration. Portfast is enabled on all access ports.
	- `spanning-tree portfast disable`, on interface.
- `spanning-tree bpdugaurd enable`, on interface
	- `spanning-tree portfast [edge] bpdugaurd enable`, from global configuration. Activates on all portfast enabled interfaces.
	- `spanning-tree bpduguard disable`
- `spanning-tree bpdufilter enable`, on interface. Port will ignore any BPDU's it receives.
	- `spanning-tree portfast [edge] bpdufilter default`, from global configuration. Activates BPDU filter on all portfast enabled interfaces.
	- `spanning-tree bpdu filter disable`.
