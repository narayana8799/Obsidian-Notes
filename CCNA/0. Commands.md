--
- `enable` to enter privileged exec mode (`#`) from user  exec mode (`>`).
	- Provides access to view device's configuration, restart the device et.
	- Cannot change the config., but can change the date on the device, save the config file, etc.
- Use  `?` to view all available commands.
- Partial command can be followed by `?` to see all available commands  by the prefix.
	- example `e?`
- `configure terminal` can be used to enter Global Configuration Mode from Privileged exec mode.
- `enable password <password>` can be used to set password for GCM from GCM. This password is asked every time user tries to enter GCM. It used Cisco propriety (7) encryption.
- `enable secret <password>` can also be used to set password for GCM from GCM. This password is asked every time user tries to enter GCM. But it much secure than `enable password` as ==it uses MD5 (5) encryption automatically==.
	- To encrypt password use `service password-encryption` command from GCM. This encrypts the password in configuration file.
- There are 2 types of configuration file's. `startu-config` and `running-config`. `running-config` has the changes we made before saving, to make them persistent we need to save the  config in `sartup-config`, which can be don in 3 different ways. These commands should be executed form privileged exec mode.
	- `write`
	- `write memory`
	- `copy running-config startup-config`
- To execute privileged exec mode commands from GM use `do` as a prefix for the command.
- Commands can be undone by adding `no` as prefix to the command.
	- ex `no service password-encryption`
