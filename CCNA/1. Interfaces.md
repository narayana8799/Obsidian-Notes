| Speed    | Common Name      | IEEE Standard | Informal Name | Maximum Length |
| -------- | ---------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| 10 Mbps  | Ethernet         | 802.3i        | 10 BASE-T     | 100 m          |
| 100 Mbps | Fast Ethernet    | 802.3u        | 100 BASE-T    | 100 m          |
| 1 Gbps   | Gigabit Ethernet | 802.3ab       | 1000 BASE-T   | 100 m          |
| 10 Gbps  | 10 Gig Ethernet  | 802.3an       | 10 GBASE-T    | 100 m          |
- Cables are twisted together to form twisted pair cabling (UTP). This helps in minimizing the effect of EMF on the cable. If there is a shield on the twisted pairs then it is called Unshielded Twisted Pair cabling, which has greater protection than UTP.
- **T** is twisted pair cabling.


#### UTP cables (10 and 100 BASE-T)

- These cable use only pins 1,2,3 and 6 for transmitting and receiving data. This is **Full Duplex** communication, cause both devices can transmit and receive at the same time.
- The pins are uni-directional, meaning transmitting pins cannot receive and vice versa.
- Straight through cables have their pins mapped with the same one on other end. These cables are used to connect different types of devices like pc to switch, switch to router.

- Cross over cables are used to connect similar devices together like switch to switch, router to router.

- Newer devices use Auto MDI-X to transmit and receive data. They adjust their pins depending on the device they are connected to. 

| Device Type | Transmit (TX) Pins | Receive (RX) Pins |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| Router      | 1 and 2            | 3 and 6           |
| Firewall    | 1 and 2            | 3 and 6           |
| PC          | 1 and 2            | 3 and 6           |
| Switch      | 3 and 6            | 1 and 2           |


#### UTP cables (1000 BASE-T and 10 GBASE-T)

- These cables use all pins to transmit and receive data.
- All pins are bi-directional, meaning they can transmit and receive.
