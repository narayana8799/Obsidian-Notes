- Set the DNS server pointing to the AD Domain Server.
- Check weather you can discover the the domain after setting the DNS server.
	- `sudo realm discover -v [realm-name]`
- Join the machine to domain (after being able to discover the domain) using the following command:
	- `sudo realm join -U [User-Name] [Domain-Name]`
- Confirm if the machine has joined the realm/domain using the following command:
	- `sudo realm list`
- After joining machine to the realm make change in the `/usr/share/pam-configs/mkhomedir` file to create home directories for the users from domain to login: (add the following lies to the `mkhomedir` file)
	- `required \t pam_mkhomedir.so umask=0022 skel=/etc/skel`
- After making changes update it using `sudo pam-auth-update --enable mkhomedir`, now when ever a user form domain joins a home directory is created.
- To give elevated permissions make changes to the `suoders` file accordingly:
	- `user@domain.com ALL=(ALL:ALL) PASSWD:ALL`


After making all the changes try logging in using the AD credentials as follows
```
username: user@domain.com
passwrod: ********
```
