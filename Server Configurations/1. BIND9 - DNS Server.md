## Forward Lookup Zones

- Forward Lookup Zones resolve names to IP addresses. They contain records such as A, AAAA, MX, CNAME, NS, TXT, SRV, SOA and CAA.

1. **A Record (Address Record):**
    - Maps a domain name to an IPv4 address.
    - Example: `example.com. IN A 192.0.2.1`
2. **AAAA Record (IPv6 Address Record):**
    - Maps a domain name to an IPv6 address.
    - Example: `example.com. IN AAAA 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`
3. **CNAME Record (Canonical Name Record):**
    - Maps an alias name to a true or canonical domain name.
    - Used for creating aliases for a domain.
    - Example: `www.example.com. IN CNAME example.com.`
4. **MX Record (Mail Exchange Record):**
    - Specifies the mail server responsible for receiving email on behalf of a domain.
    - Includes a priority value to allow for multiple mail servers.
    - Example: `example.com. IN MX 10 mail.example.com.`
5. **TXT Record (Text Record):**
    - Holds arbitrary text, often used for verification, domain ownership, and other purposes.
    - Commonly used for SPF (Sender Policy Framework), DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail), and other email authentication methods.
    - Example: `example.com. IN TXT "v=spf1 include:_spf.example.com ~all"`
6. **SRV Record (Service Record):**
    - Specifies the location of servers for specific services, such as SIP or XMPP.
    - Contains the service name, protocol, priority, weight, port, and target.
    - Example: `_sip._tcp.example.com. IN SRV 10 5 5060 sipserver.example.com.`
7. **NS Record (Name Server Record):**
    - Specifies the authoritative name servers for a domain.
    - Example: `example.com. IN NS ns1.example.com.`
8. **PTR Record (Pointer Record):**
    - Maps an IP address to a canonical domain name.
    - Used primarily in reverse lookup zones but occasionally appears in forward zones for special purposes.
    - Example: `1.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa. IN PTR example.com.`
9. **SOA Record (Start of Authority Record):**
    - Indicates the primary name server for the zone and contains administrative information.
    - Includes the primary name server, responsible person's email, serial number, refresh time, retry time, expire time, and minimum TTL.
10. **CAA Record (Certification Authority Authorization Record):**
    - Specifies which certificate authorities (CAs) are allowed to issue certificates for a domain.
    - Helps in preventing unauthorized certificate issuance.
    - Example: `example.com. IN CAA 0 issue "letsencrypt.org"`


- A DNS zone is a portion of the DNS namespace that is managed by a specific organization or administrator. A DNS zone is an administrative space which allows for more granular control of DNS components, such as authoritative nameservers.
- For example, imagine a hypothetical zone for the cloudflare.com domain and three of its subdomains: support.cloudflare.com, community.cloudflare.com, and blog.cloudflare.com. Suppose the blog is a robust, independent site that needs separate administration, but the support and community pages are more closely associated with cloudflare.com and can be managed in the same zone as the primary domain. In this case, cloudflare.com as well as the support and community sites would all be in one zone, while blog.cloudflare.com would exist in its own zone.

- when `recursion yes/no` is enabled, if the DNS server does not have the answer, it will query other DNS server on behalf of the client to resolve query. We can allow recursion only on particular hosts by adding them to `allow-recursion { trusted-hosts; }; `, where trusted hosts is an `acl` defined outside options: `acl "trusted-hosts" {ip-1; ...}; `
- When recursion is enabled on a DNS server with public IP, it can become a part of large scale DNS network and it can be prone to DNS Amplification Attacks. It is suggested to limit its functionality particular hosts using `acl's`.

#### SOA - Start Of Authority Record

```
$TTL 86400
@   IN  SOA ns1.example.com. admin.example.com. (
            2024071801 ; Serial
            3600       ; Refresh
            1800       ; Retry
            1209600    ; Expire
            86400 )    ; Minimum TTL

@   IN  NS   ns1.example.com.
@   IN  A    ip-address

ns1 IN  A    ip-address
www IN  A    ip-address

```

- **MNAME:** Primary Name Server is a parameter that specifies a primary authoritative DNS server for the zone. It has the original master copy, manages updates and changes to the zone. 
    
- **RNAME:** The responsible person parameter designates the email address of the entity responsible for the DNS zone administration. These email addresses are normally in the format of “Host.example.com,” where @ used in normal email addresses is replaced by a full stop to comply with DNS syntax. 
    
- **SERIAL:** Serial number is a version number assigned to the zone file. It serves as a tracking number that is updated each time a change is made to the zone, helping keep track of the updates. It also helps the secondary DNS server know when they need to update the copy of their zone.
    
- **REFRESH:** Refresh interval defines when the secondary DNS server will check the primary server’s serial number and confirm if it needs an update. This parameter will keep secondary servers up to date.
    
- **RETRY:** Retry interval specifies when a DNS server will retry a failed zone transfer. This parameter ensures reliable zone transfers through effective communication between primary and secondary servers.
    
- **EXPIRE:** Expiration time sets when a secondary DNS server will continue to respond to the zone if it cannot contact the primary server. Once this time has elapsed, the secondary server will stop responding authoritatively to the zone so it doesn't provide outdated information. 
    
- **TTL:** Minimum time to live parameters will specify the TTL for resource records in the zone. It determines how long DNS resolvers will cache the records. After this time has elapsed, the DNS resolvers request fresh data from authoritative servers.


## Reverse Lookup Zones

Reverse Lookup Zones resolve IP addresses to names. The name of the zone file for a `10.0.2.0/24` network should follow the convention `2.0.10.in-addr.arpa.dns`, (added dns extension to identify it as a dns file). RLZ support's only PTR records.

**PTR Record (Pointer Record):**
- The primary record type for reverse DNS lookups.
- Maps an IP address to a domain name.
- Example for IPv4: `1.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa. IN PTR example.com.`
- Example for IPv6: `4.3.2.1.0.0.0.0.8.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa. IN PTR example.com.`
