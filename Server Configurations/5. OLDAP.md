- OLDAP is a Open-source Light Weight Directory Access Protocol. The directory is a database that can store any number of types of objects in it like user accounts, computer accounts, folders, emails, contacts etc. It maintains a schema to store objects. These stored objects can be accessed using OLDAP.
- It is primarily used for user authentication in the industry.
- `Entry` is a single unit in LDAP identified by Distinguished Name (`dn`)
- `attribute` is the information associated with an entry. An entry can have multiple attribute's. Attributes can either be optional or required.
- Required attributes are specified using the `objectClass` definition, and can be found in schema files located in the `/etc/openldap/slapd.d/cn=config/cn=schema/` directory.
- The assertion of an attribute and its corresponding value is also referred to as a _Relative Distinguished Name_ (RDN). Unlike distinguished names that are unique globally, a relative distinguished name is only unique per entry.
- **LDIF** is a plain text representation of an entry.
- Global configuration options for the LDAP server are stored in the `/etc/openldap/slapd.d/cn=config.ldif` file.
