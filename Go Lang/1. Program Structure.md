1.1 Names
--

Names should always start with letters (either upper or lowercase) or underscore and can contain any number of numbers, letters or underscore's in the middle.

There are a total of 5 keywords in Go Language.

If an entity is declared within a function, it is local to that function. If declared outside of a
function, however, it is visible in all files of the package to which it belongs. The case of the
first letter of a name determines its visibility across package boundaries. If the name begins
with an upper-case letter, it is exported, which means that it is visible and accessible outside of its own package and may be referred to by other parts of the program, as with `Printf` in the `fmt` package. Package names themselves are always in lower case.

Built-in functions in Go. These function cab re-defined as er the need but it can cause confusion, so always beware when re-defining them.

1.2 Declarations
--

A declaration names a program entity and specifies some or all of its properties. There are
four major kinds of declarations: `var`, `const`, `type`, and `func`.

Each `go` file begins with a package declaration that says what package the file is part of. The package declaration is followed by any import declarations, and then a sequence of package-level declarations of types, variables, constants, and functions, in any order.

A function declaration has a name, a list of parameters , an optional list of results, and the function body, which contains the statements that define what the function does. The result list is omitted if the function does not return anything. Execution of the function begins with the first statement and continues until it encounters a return statement or reaches the end of a function that has no results. Control and any results are then returned to the caller.

```
package main
import "fmt"

func main() {
	var a, b int = 10, -20
	result := add(a, b)
	fmt.Println(result)
}

func add(a, b int) int {
	return a + b
}
```

1.3 Variables
--
A variable can hold data of a particular data type. In Go language a variable can be declared in different ways.

```
- var variable data-type ///// will be initiazed with 0, '', 0.0, flase and nil  (called zero-values)depending on the datatype.
- var varable data-tye = expression
- var i, j, k int //// int, int, int
- var b, f, s = true, 2.3, "four" //// bool, float64, string
```

The zero-value mechanism ensures that a variable always holds a well-defined value of its type; in Go there is no such thing as an uninitialized variable. This simplifies code and often
ensures sensible behavior of boundary conditions without extra work.

1.3.1 Short Variable Declarations
--
Within a function, an alternate form called a short variable declaration may be used to declare and initialize local variables. It takes the form `name := expression`, and the type of name is determined by the type of expression.

Multiple declarations can be made at the same time like normal variables `i, j := 0, 1`.

- **It is important to note that `:=` is a declaration and `=` is an assignment.**  A multi-variable declaration should not be confused with a tuple assignment, in which each variable on the left-hand side is assigned the corresponding value from the right-hand side:

		`i, j = j, i ` // swap values of i and j

- *If one of the variable used in short variable declaration has already been used, then the variable value will be updated (if the data-type matches or an error will be thrown)*
- *A short variable declaration must declare at least one new variable.*

1.3.2 Pointers
--
Variables are used to store values and are identified using their names. A Pointer value  is the address of a variable. *Not every value has an address, but every value does*.

A Pointer can be used to modify the value of a variable indirectly, without even using the name of the variable.

```
x := 1
p := &x
// p, of type *int, points to x
fmt.Println(*p) // "1"
*p = 2
// equivalent to x = 2
fmt.Println(x) // "2"
```

- From the above example, `&x`  (which can pronounced as *address of* `x`) yields the pointer to `x` of type `*int` (which ca n pronounced as *pointer to* `int`). 
- `*p` yields the value of the variable it is pointing it to.

Each component of a variable of aggregate type—a field of a struct or an element of an array— is also a variable and thus has an address too.. The zero value of any pointer is `nil`.

Because a pointer contains the address of a variable, passing a pointer argument to a function makes it possible for the function to update the variable that was indirectly passed.

Each time we take the address of a variable or copy a pointer, we create new aliases or ways to identify the same variable.

1.3.3 The `new` Function
--
Another way to create a variable is to use the built-in function new. The expression new(T)
creates an unnamed variable of type T, initializes it to the zero value of T, and returns its
address, which is a value of type *T.

```
p := new(int)
// p, of type *int, points to an unnamed int variable
fmt.Println(*p) // "0"
*p = 2
// sets the unnamed int to 2
fmt.Println(*p) // "2"
```

There is one exception to this rule: two variables whose type carries no information and is
therefore of size zero, such as `struct{}` or `[0]int`, may, depending on the implementation,
have the same address.

1.3.4 Lifetime of Variable
--
The lifetime of a variable is the interval of time during which it exists as the program executes. The lifetime of a package-level variable is the entire execution of the program. By contrast, local variables have dynamic lifetimes: a new instance is created each time the declaration statement is executed, and the variable lives on until it becomes unreachable, at which point its storage may be recycled. Function parameters and results are local variables too; they are created each time their enclosing function is called.

```
for t := 0.0; t < cycles*2*math.Pi; t += res {
	x := math.Sin(t)
	y := math.Sin(t*freq + phase)
	img.SetColorIndex(size+int(x*size+0.5), size+int(y*size+0.5),
	blackIndex)
}
```

The variable t is created each time the for loop begins, and new variables x and y are created on each iteration of the loop.

Sometimes a variable can escape from a function and can be reachable even after the function is returned. Consider the below example.

```
var global *int
func f() {
	var x int
	x = 1
	global = &x
}
```

Here `X` exists even after the function `f` a
is returned, this is due to the pointer referencing X's location in the global variable.

1.4 Assignments
--
The value held by a variable is updated by an assignment statement, which in its simplest form has a variable on the left of the `=` sign and an expression on the right.

```
x = 1 // named variable
*p = true // indirect variable
person.name = "bob" // struct field
count[x] = count[x] * scale // array or slice or map element

```

Each of the arithmetic and bit wise binary operators has a corresponding assignment operator allowing, for example, the last statement to be rewritten as which saves us from having to repeat (and re-evaluate) the expression for the variable.

```
count[x] *= scale
a += b
a -= b
a /= b
```

Increment and decrement of numerical variables

```
v++ // v = v + 1 or v += 1
v-- // v = v - 1 or v -= 1
```

Tuple assignments allow several variables to be assigned at once. All right-hand side expressions are evaluated first and then assigned to the variables on the left.

` x, y = y, x`

- Unwanted values can be assigned  to underscore like `_, ok = x.(T)`.
- The type should match on both sides while assigning values to variables.
- `nil` can be assigned to an data type.
- Data type should match while making any type of comparisons.

1.5 Type Declarations
--
A type declaration defines a new named type that has the same underlying type as an existing type. The named type provides a way to separate different and perhaps incompatible uses of  the underlying type so that they can’t be mixed unintentionally.

`type name underlying-type`

Type declarations most often appear at package level, where the named type is visible throughout the package, and if the name is exported (it starts with an upper-case letter), it’s accessible from other packages as well.

```
package tempconv
import "fmt"

type Celsius float64
type Fahrenheit float64

const (
	AbsoluteZeroC Celsius = -273.15
	FreezingC
	Celsius = 0
	BoilingC
	Celsius = 100
)

func CToF(c Celsius) Fahrenheit { return Fahrenheit(c*9/5 + 32) }
func FToC(f Fahrenheit) Celsius { return Celsius((f - 32) * 5 / 9) }
```

From the above example, though both Fahrenheit and Celsius have the same underlying data type, both are not same type. Both types can be converted to other type using explicit type conversion like `Celsius(f)` and `Fahrenheit(c)`.

For every type `T`, there is a corresponding conversion operation `T(x)` that converts the value x to type `T`. A conversion from one type to another is allowed if both have the same underlying type, or if both are unnamed pointer types that point to variables of the same underlying type; these conversions change the type but not the representation of the value. If `x` is assignable to `T`, a conversion is permitted but is usually redundant.

Type's methods can be used to control how values of type appear when printed on the screen.

`func (c Celsius) String() string { return fmt.Sprintf("%g°C", c) }`
