 libvirt acts as a transparent layer that takes commands from users, modifies them
based on the underlying virtualization technology, and then executes them on the
hypervisor. This means that if you know how to use libvirt-based management tools,
you should be able to manage the preceding set of hypervisors without knowing
them individually. You can select any virtualization management technology. They
all use libvirt as their back-end infrastructure management layer, even though the
front-end tools look different; for example, oVirt, Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
(RHEV), OpenStack, Eucalyptus, and so on. This book is all about KVM libvirt and
its tools.

 `virt-host-validate` tests weather the system passes all checks.

Now, let's see what other parameters are checked by the virt-host-validate
command when it's executed to validate a system for KVM virtualization:

- `/dev/kvm`: The KVM drivers create a `/dev/kvm` character device on the host to facilitate direct hardware access for virtual machines. Not having this device means that the VMs won't be able to access physical hardware, although it's enabled in the BIOS and this will reduce the VMs, performance significantly.
- `/dev/vhost-net`: The vhost-net driver creates a `/dev/vhost-net` character device on the host. This character device serves as the interface to configure the vhost-net instance. Not having this device significantly reduces the virtual machine's network performance.
- `/dev/net/tun`: This is another character special device used for creating tun/tap devices to facilitate network connectivity for a virtual machine. The tun/tap device will be explained in detail in future chapters. For now, just understand that having a character device is important for KVM virtualization to work properly.

`virsh` command can be used manage VM's and hypervisor. It uses `libvirt` management API and is an alternative for `virt-manager`. The following are some important classifications of `virsh` commands:

- Guest management commands (for example `start`, `stop`)
- Guest monitoring commands (for example `memstat`, `cpustat`)
- Host and hypervisors commands (for example `capabilities`, `nodeinfo`)
- Virtual networking commands (for example `net-list`, `net-define`)
- Storage management commands (for example `pool-list`, `pool-define`)
- Snapshot commands (`create-snapshot-as`)
