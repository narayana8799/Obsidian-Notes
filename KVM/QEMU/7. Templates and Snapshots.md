A virtual machine template (more commonly referred to as simply a template) is a pre-configured operating system image that can used to quickly deploy virtual machines. Using templates, you can avoid many repetitive installation and configuration tasks. The result is a fully installed, ready to operate (virtual) server in less time than manual installation would take.

`virt-clone` and `virt-sysprep` and other operating systems sealing utilities can be used to create templates, although they are not intended for creating templates. We create and manage templates with the help of the `virsh` and `qemu-img` commands and deploy virtual machines from a template using the thin and clone methods:

- **Thin method:** A virtual machine deployed using the thin cloning mechanism uses the template image as a base image in read-only mode and links an additional "copy on write image" to store newly generated data. It requires less disk space but cannot run without access to the base template image.
- **Clone method:** A virtual machine deployed using the full cloning mechanism creates a complete copy of the virtual machine that is fully independent of the original VM or VM template. But it requires the same disk space as the original.

`virt-sysprep` prepares a Linux virtual machine to become a template or clone by removing system-specific information automatically so that clones can be made from it. `virt-sysprep` can also customize a virtual machine, for instance by adding SSH keys, users, or logos.

```
- virt-sysprep -d <vm-name>
- virt-sysprep -a /path/to/disk // can also be used whn guest is not defined
- virt-sysprep --list-operations // lists all operations it performs on VM
- virt-sysre --operations list,of,operations [-d, -a] [vm-name or disk]
```

==After using `virt-sysprep` on a VM, it is recommended to not never start a VM as it will lose all `sysprep` operations and might cause problems in VM's deployed using thin method.==

After completing the `sysprep` step, the XML file of the VM should be saved and the VM's should be shutoff.
